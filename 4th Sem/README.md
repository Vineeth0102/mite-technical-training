<h1>Problem statement </h1>
<h2>Morse Code Conversion Program</h2>
<p>Morse code is a system of communication that uses dots and dashes to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. A dot is a short signal, and a dash is a long signal. The spaces between signals represent the separation between letters, words, and sentences.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Morse code converter is a tool that translates Morse code, a series of dots and dashes, into human-readable text and vice versa. It simplifies Morse code communication by automatically decoding or encoding messages, making it accessible to a wider audience. Users input Morse code or text, and the converter provides the corresponding translation. This tool is invaluable in contexts like amateur radio communication, emergency signaling, and historical research. Modern Morse code converters are available as software applications, web tools, or mobile apps, offering convenience and versatility for Morse code enthusiasts and those who need to work with Morse code in various situations.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>A text editor to write the C program. Any text editor will do, but a dedicated C editor like Code:Blocks or Visual Studio Code will make your life easier.</li>
<li>A C compiler to convert the C program into machine code that can be executed by the computer. There are many different C compilers available, but GCC is a popular and free option.</li>
<li>A linker to combine the object files generated by the compiler into an executable file. The linker also resolves any dependencies between the object files.</li>
<li>A runtime environment to provide the necessary resources for the C program to execute. The runtime environment typically includes a library of functions that the C program can call.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Military Communication</li>
<li>Maritime Communication</li>
<li>Aviation</li>
<li>Emergency Signaling</li>
<li>Telegraphy and Early Telecommunications</li>
</ul>
